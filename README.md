Preprint Notice
This repository contains the author's preprint manuscript of the paper titled "IIM (Information Integration Model): Consciousness as a Compensatory Patch under Physical Speed Limits".
Status: Submitted to Synthese (under review).

"Truth does not require complex vocabulary to be true. It only requires a mind that refuses to look away from the fundamental constraints of reality."

The Fundamental Postulate

The Information Integration Model (IIM) is a first-principles framework proposing that human consciousness is not an evolutionary "luxury," but a mandatory algorithmic patch necessitated by the universal speed of causality.

The Logical Chain: From Physics to Anxiety

Universal Speed Limit (c): Information propagation has an absolute physical upper bound.

Structural Latency: An unavoidable millisecond-scale delay exists between a physical event and a biological system's neural processing of that event.

The Interactive Paradox: Any system that reacts only to "received" signals is reacting to the past. In a dynamic environment, reacting to the past is maladaptive.

The Predictive Patch (Consciousness): To maintain real-time interaction, the brain must generate a simulation of the present. Consciousness is this Predictive Simulation that bridges the gap between perceived past and immediate physical reality.

Anxiety as Kinetic Cost: Chronic anxiety is interpreted as the "Structural Maintenance Fee" paid by the system to maintain high-precision predictive simulations under uncertainty.

Core Contributions

Philosophical Impact: Bridging the Gap
IIM provides a physicalist approach to the "Hard Problem of Consciousness." It redefines the "Self" as a persistent error-correction algorithm, demystifying subjective experience as a functional interface necessitated by relativistic physics.

Practical & Engineering Applications

AGI Architecture: Suggests that machine consciousness may require engineered Artificial Latency and survival constraints to force the development of a "Predictive Self."

Clinical Cognitive Science: Proposes a paradigm shift in viewing anxiety from "fixing a broken mind" to "optimizing energy allocation for a predictive system."

Human Performance: Introduces "Time Dilation" (the refresh rate of the compensatory patch) as a potential metric for high-stress decision-making.

Methodology: The Power of First Principles
This model is built on Raw Logical Deduction from established physical constraints. Analogous to how quantum mechanics reveals macro-stability rooted in micro-discreteness, IIM posits that the macro-continuity of consciousness is a necessary patch for the micro-latency of causality.

On CPT: The Companion Framework
IIM represents the deconstruction (破) of perceived reality. It is complemented by a separate, operational framework for intellectual sovereignty and mental defense — CPT (Critical Practice Postulatism), which represents the construction (立). Full documentation of CPT is held privately. Inquiries from those who grasp IIM's implications and seek the "Construction" are welcome.
